"""Build the molle-iptv playlists.

The point of this workflow is that a visitor who clicks a channel gets a
picture. Two things stand in the way, and both are handled here:

  * roughly half of the public streams out there don't work in a browser at
    all — see stream_status() — so they're tested and the dead ones dropped.
    A stream that merely refuses *this* machine is kept and marked instead:
    the build runs in the United States and the audience does not, and DR1
    and DR2 answer perfectly well in Copenhagen.
  * the source playlists are barely categorised. A quarter of them arrive as
    "Undefined", and one source labels its groups by country instead. Nobody
    browses 3,000 uncategorised channels, so the category, country and region
    are filled in from iptv-org's API by tvg-id rather than guessed.

Two files come out:

  playlist.m3u8      validated. Only channels a browser can actually play,
                     from any hosting. This is the one to embed.

  playlist-all.m3u8  everything we merged, enriched but unvalidated. Correct
                     for VLC, Kodi and TiviMate, which don't care about http://
                     or CORS and can play a great deal more.

    The distinction matters because the build runs on a GitHub runner in the

    answer 200 in Copenhagen and refuse the runner, and an earlier version of
    this check deleted them for it — channels that had never once failed for
    an actual visitor.

    So an access refusal is not evidence that a stream is dead. It is evidence
    that *this machine* may not watch it, which is a different fact and not
    one worth deleting a channel over. Those are kept and marked; the player
    can tell the visitor a channel may need to be in its home country.
